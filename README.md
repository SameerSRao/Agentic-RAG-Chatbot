Agentic RAG Chatbot is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by CrewAI agents. It uses LLMs, vector databases, and automated evaluation to answer nuanced literary questions about The Great Gatsby. This project was developed for the AI+QA New Hire Challenge to demonstrate thoughtful architecture, intelligent agent collaboration, and measurable answer quality.
